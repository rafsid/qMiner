### Review and Suggestions:

1. **Error Handling**: The current code does not include any error handling. If the request to the URL fails or the webpage structure changes, the script will crash. It's a good practice to add try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

2. **User-Agent Header**: Some websites may block requests that do not have a User-Agent header. Adding a User-Agent header can help mimic a real browser request.

3. **Logging**: Adding logging statements can help in debugging and understanding the flow of the script.

4. **Configuration File**: Hardcoding the URL inside the script is not ideal. It would be better to read the URL from a configuration file or command-line argument.

5. **Data Validation**: The script assumes that all required elements (`h2`, `p.description`, `span.deadline`) are present in each project `div`. It would be safer to add checks to ensure these elements exist before trying to access them.

### Updated Code:
